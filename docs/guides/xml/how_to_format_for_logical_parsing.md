Our goal is to have a document format that you can easily process for logical reasoning. Furthmore, the format we decide upon (XML maybe?) allows you to reference concepts via an artifact that we can upload in Project knowledge. Please use these outline numbers when answering the following questions.
1. First is there any syntax there (markdown) that is superfluous and doesn't support you in parsing the file for your understanding?
2. What is the use of keypairs separated by the colon (key:value). Does it matter if the keypair has a line break at the colon?
3. Markdown use of '**' for bold. Does this support your understanding?
4. Markdown us of '###'. Does this support your understanding?
5. Markdown use of indents. Does this support your understanding?
6. Outline numbering? Does this support your understanding?
7. Finally, the use of parathesis (how are you semantically processing the contents?)
